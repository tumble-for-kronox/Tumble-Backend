### `fas:List` Fields

`message` : [[string]]
This is a description of what the error was that occurred. The message is primarily for development as error messages need to be based on error codes for translations.

### `far:QuestionCircle` Example
```json
{
    "message": "Couldn't find the data."
}
```
